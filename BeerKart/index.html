                Although recycling has become a more widely accepted and used practice today,
                there’s no denying that many still opt for the opposite. This is especially
                true for students who continue to throw away their empty alcohol bottles/cans
                 into the trash. Coming into Hack the North, my team and I soundly agreed that
                  this concern should be addressed and a solution should be taken to the web.
                  We feel that not only will creating a web application for recycling promote
                  better social good and foster environmental practises on campus, students who
                   join as “Collectors” can also earn a quick buck by recycling bottles/cans to
                    the Beer Store.
            </p>

              The world is becoming more and more interconnected with technology. With BeerKart,
               we want to create a web application where we connect people who want to get rid of
               their empty alcohol cans/bottles with people who are passionate about recycling.
            </p>
              <h4>What does it do?</h4> <p class="body pad-s">Think UBER, but instead of people picking up and transporting other
               people, BeerKart lets people pick up empty bottles/cans from other people, and bring
               it to recycling facilities to properly dispose of it and make some money off it!</p>

               <h4>How does it work?</h4> <p class="body pad-s">Simply sign into the web app. Choose whether you want to schedule
               a pick up for your empty bottles/cans, or if you want to be a collector of bottles/cans.
               If you choose the first option, you’ll be able to complete a pick-up request form and
               submit a request for someone to take it off your hands. If you choose the latter option,
                you’ll get to see all pick up order requests and then select one location to pick up
                your bottles/cans.</p>

                <h4>What's next?</h4>
                <p class="body pad-s">As with all minimal viable products, we were quite selective in our chosen feature set list.
                We felt that these features really embodied BeerKart’s values and purpose and met the core
                needs of our target user. Given that we only had 36 hours to create BeerKart, there were
                some definite elements that we had to exclude. We hope to bring them in to the next iteration
                 of the product. These things include:
                 <ol type="1">
                   <li><p class="body pad-s">UX and UI Design: Conducting thorough user research to understand the pain points
                     of our user and continue to improve the user experience and user interface design.</p></li>
                   <li><p class="body pad-s">New and Improved Features: We hope to implement a few more features that we believe
                    would truly benefit the web application. These include the ability for a user to
                    schedule bottle pick up services with date, time, and location, the ability to
                    auto-assign Collectors with pick up orders, the ability to give Collectors and
                    Schedulers a star rating after pick up, and to have a continuous search method
                    that will allow Collectors to be auto assigned to pick up orders so long as they
                     are online and available.</p></li>
